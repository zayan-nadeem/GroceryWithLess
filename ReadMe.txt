This is basically an Angular Application with LESS/CSS to sytle the front.

To run this you would have to fetch it to a local folder.

and run the httpserver

I am adding screen shots in case as well.


This application is only working for Chrome Right now. I did not have the chance to test it on FireFox/IE
